# Preface

The data and AI field has exploded in recent years, opening up countless career opportunities. But with so many roles, tools, and learning paths, figuring out where to start can feel overwhelming. Every other day, I get messages from beginners and enthusiasts asking the same question:  
**“How can I get into data and AI?”**  

I’ve been answering this question for a long time, and over the years, I’ve refined my response based on the follow-up questions people ask. Some of the most common ones include:

- What’s the difference between data science, data engineering, machine learning, data architecture, and other sub-fields?
- What does the end-to-end process look like, and who does what?
- What key concepts, tools, and technologies should I focus on?
- What are the best books, courses, blogs, and podcasts to learn from?
- How can I build a strong portfolio based on my chosen role?
- How do I write a resume for a data and AI job?
- How do I connect with the right people in the industry?
- What’s the best way to search for jobs and prepare for interviews?
- How can I stay relevant in this fast-changing field?

These are not just conceptual questions—they are practical challenges that many aspiring professionals face. And unfortunately, there’s no single resource that answers them all in a structured way.

## What’s Coming in the Book?

To solve this problem, I’ve put together a book that serves as a **step-by-step guide for anyone looking to break into data and AI**. Instead of giving you a generic roadmap, it will help you **build your own roadmap** based on your interests and goals.

The book is structured in four phases, similar to how a rocket launch works:

🚀 **Explore** – Understand the data and AI ecosystem, different roles, and where you fit in.  
🛠 **Build** – Learn essential skills, tools, and technologies while working on real projects.  
🎯 **Launch** – Create a strong portfolio, optimize your resume, and prepare for interviews.  
🛰 **Steer** – Stay up to date, grow in your career, and adapt to new trends.  

Whether you’re just starting out or transitioning from another field, this book will help you navigate your way with **clarity and confidence**.

## What’s Next?

If you’ve ever felt lost about how to start your data and AI journey, this book is for you.   

Let’s build your roadmap together.
